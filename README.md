# food_safety

I spent nearly a year working for the Food Safety and Inspection agency, mostly wrangling data. So I figured I would see what good it's brought me. With their publicly available data (https://www.fsis.usda.gov/wps/portal/fsis/topics/inspection/mpi-directory), I did some basic analysis to visualize the geographic distribution of meat, poultry, and egg producers.

The data can be downloaded here: https://www.fsis.usda.gov/wps/wcm/connect/3e414e13-d601-427c-904a-319e2e84e487/MPI_Directory_by_Establishment_Name.xls?MOD=AJPERES.
